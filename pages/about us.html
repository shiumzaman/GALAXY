	<h1>About us</h1>

	<p>Space has Galaxies and Planets which generally aren't rocks throw distance from each other. Technically, they can beâ€¦ considering everything in space is a rock, to begin with.</p>
	<p>Everything turns, rotates, spins, circles, loops, pulsates, resonates, and repeats.Circles of life, born from pulses of light, vibrate to breathe, while spiraling outwards for infinity through the lens of time.</p>

	<p>Everybody has a little bit of the sun and moon in them. Everybody has a little bit of man, woman, and animal in them. Darks and lights in them.<br>Everyone is part of a connected cosmic system. Part earth and sea, wind and fire, with some salt and dust swimming in them.<br>We have a universe within ourselves that mimics the universe outside. None of us are just black or white, or never wrong and always right.<br>No one. No one exists without polarities. Everybody has good and bad forces working with them, against them, and within them.</p>
